# Stack


Stack is a linear data structure which follows LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out) pattern.

# Standard Operations
1. push() –  Place an item onto the stack. If there is no place for new item, stack is in overflow state.
2. pop() – Return the item at the top of the stack and then remove it. If pop is called when stack is empty, it is in an underflow state.
3. isEmpty() –  Tells if the stack is empty or not
4. isfull() – Tells if the stack is full or not.
5. peek() – Access the item at the ith position
6. count() – Get the number of items in the stack.
7. change() – Change the item at the ith position
8. display() – Display all the items in the stack
